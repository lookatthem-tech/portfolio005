A Qualifying Event is a life event which would cause the employee to lose coverage under their active employee benefits. \n\nWhen a client’s employee experiences one of these qualifying events (“QEs”), our system generates a COBRA package for the employee. Once this package has been approved by our client, we send out what is called an “Election Notice” to the employee. This election notice offers them the same benefits they had when they were on active employee benefits. Election Notices will always be sent out via US postage. We also send notices via email if we were given a personal email for the member.\n\nThe employee has 60 days from the date the Election Notice was sent to elect for COBRA coverage before their election is void. If the employee elects, they become a COBRA member, and they pay their monthly premiums to us. The member remains active on benefits as long as they continue to pay their monthly premiums, which we remit back to the client. Although members have a coverage period (which is normally 18 months), the member can reach out to us to terminate coverage early.',l:''},'Coverage Period':{d:'The stability (coverage) period is a period during which health coverage is provided to ACA full time equivalent employees.\n\nThe stability period after an initial measurement period is 12 months starting the first day of the following month after the employee’s initial measurement period ends.\n\nThe stability period after the standard measurement period is January 1 to December 31.',l:''},'EDI':{d:'EDI stands for Electronic Data Interchange.
